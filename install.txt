How Do I think
1- Create a reactive component 
2- Handle drag& drop and input for file
3- Table that show & sort
4- Handle the storage of the file (store)
5- Process the file in chunk
 - count how many row & chunk it to X per jobs
 - process all job using batch
 - notify user through event + pusher for every process (pending/processing/failed/complete)
 - store product using upsert 
6- migration & factory & model
7- service class to Handle
8- start 1-7 with tdd(unit test)
